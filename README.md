# Data-Cleaning-Proyect
I'm transforming to tidy data.
So in the code, in the first part I read the data in the working directory.
Then i start with the test, so i made the data frame to combine subject, activity and the feature
the same thin with the train data set. Then i mergue both data sets into one called "data_mergue".
I use the comand grep to get match the "mean" and "std", grep give the positions, so then i use that vector to get the data. I called this "data_sub"
##ACTIVITY NAME
This part is about putting labels to the data, so in the txt file explain it so only i match the vector with the data set sub.
##labels
So in this part os about manipulating names of variables so we use metacharacteres to do this and replace all confusing names and replace it to the ones to get a better
understanding 
##New tidy
so this last part is creating a new file that is tidy
